# Smart Gallery
Smart Gallery serves as a platform to generate images according to the user’s prompt using DALL-E API. It also maintains a gallery to show previously generated images.

DALL·E’s flexibility allows users to create and edit original images ranging from the artistic to the photorealistic. DALL·E excels at following natural language descriptions so users can plainly describe what they want to see. 


The design tool used was Figma. The web app was developed using react as frontend and express, node as backend.
